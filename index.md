title: Johan Lassen - project portfolio and CV

## Intro

I have (almost) done a PhD in bioinformatics, where I used machine learning to optimize the outcome of data analysis in mass spectrometry for clinical purposes.

Note: Mass spectrometry is used to analyze molecules, such as proteins, hormones, and nutrients depending on the technology.

My projects include everything from simple linear regressions and t-tests to custom neural networks. The mass spectral data is extremely convoluted and can be represented as images that looks like noise to the human eye. Hence, my goal has been to:

1. Optimize algorithmic preprocessing of the mass spectral data by machine learning.
2. Use end-to-end deep learning to skip algorithmic preprocessing.
3. Accomodate technical noise in mass spectral measurements by thorough study design.

My research has contributed to two overall goals:
1. Obtain a mass spectrum to get a *molecular image* that tells whether a person is sick.
2. Getting multible *molecular images* to evaluate progress of:
    * Aging related diseases
    * Recovery
    * Personal health goals

It has been quite an adventure, and as my PhD ends by the end of 2024, I aim to enter the private sector. I am open to job offers of any kind in any field, as long as it takes an analytical mind.

Feel free to check out my CV and my project portfolio which I will try to keep updated (and in plain language)
