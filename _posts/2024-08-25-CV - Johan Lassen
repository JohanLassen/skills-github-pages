# Johan Lassen      Data Scientist & ML specialist
E: johanlassen@live.dk | M: +45 60563035

My PhD has taught me to work structured, be a helpful colleague, be proactive, and see things through when projects become monsters. I have a good intuition and methodology for efficient screening of different modeling approaches. My great motivators include successfully closing projects, interdisciplinary collaborations, supervision of master students, learning new technologies, and the creative process of implementing models.
My PhD contract ends on the 6th of December, and I am applying for jobs in the private sector. I hope to become a part of a strong team, master industrial technologies, and create results that matter! Starting dates: 1st of January or 1st of December (I hand in early).
